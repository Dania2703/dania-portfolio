# Dania Dabbah - Software & Data Engineer Portfolio

This is a static portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, and projects in Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Quality Assurance.

## Project Structure

The entire portfolio is consolidated into three simple files for easy deployment and management:

*   `index.html`: The main structure of the website, including all content and inline Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   `style.css`: Contains the full, compiled CSS to maintain the original design and styling.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## How to View

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in any web browser.

Alternatively, you can deploy this to any static hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) by simply uploading the three files and the `dania_portfolio/client/public/images/hero-bg.png` image.
